# Password-Master
Simple password master based on hash functions and pseudo random.

## Before use
1. Paste your secret key (hex like)
```py
SECRET_KEY: bytes = bytes.fromhex("YOUR PRIVATE HEX KEY")  # 14 line
```
Okay, that program ready to use.

## How it works?
1. You write a note for any password.
2. Write a subpassword.
3. Autocopy password to buffer and use it.
